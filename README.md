# How to use:
## Use ```Retro Proxy Setup.bat``` to Install or Update a portable WaybackProxy and Python 3.9.
## Use ```Retro Proxy Start.bat``` to start it
## Use ```Retro Proxy Stop.bat``` to stop it (it kills python3.exe process, close it yourself if you don't want it to happen)
## Use ```Retro Date Change.bat``` to change WaybackProxy date in config. If proxy is already running, it will close it, apply config change and start it. When updating, it restores the last date you used.
